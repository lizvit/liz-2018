    <p> Hey guys! I am currently a senior in STEM Early College H.S. 
    I will be graduating from HS and Palo Alto College. After graduating I want to continue
    my education and become a RN. Witnessing my grandmother recover her health inspired me
    to pursue a major in nursing. I have completed 16 hours of college science courses that 
    have exposed me to functions of the human body within musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
    cardiovascular, and nervous systems. These courses are the foundation of a degree in
    nursing and the enjoyment I experience while taking these courses has strengthened my
    commitment to the career and made me even more curious to learn about patient's symptoms,
    disease identification and treatment.</p>
